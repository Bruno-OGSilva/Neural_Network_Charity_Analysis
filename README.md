# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
---
This purpose of this project is to build a deep learning neural network with at least 75% predictive accuracy of determining the success or failure of charitable donations to non-profit companies, analyzing data from more than 34,000 organizations.

## FEATURES AND DATA SOURCES
- Data Source: `charity_data.csv`

## Summary
---

Overall, my model was not able to acheive the 75% predictive accuracy threshold requested by the challenge prompt.
I would recommend using SVM model to reach the 75% accuracy target. SVMs are recommended because they are specific desingned to identifying a singular output or target variable.
